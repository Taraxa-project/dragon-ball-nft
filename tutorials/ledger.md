Welcome back! In this part of the tutorial, we're exploring the Dragon Ball Super Ledger contract. This is an exciting example of an ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) contract with additional features like listing NFTs for sale and integrating with an ERC20 token. Let's dive in!

Displayed on your screen is the Dragon Ball Super Ledger contract. This contract is a bit more complex than a standard ERC721, as it includes features for trading NFTs within a specific community.

We begin with a series of import statements from OpenZeppelin, a trusted source for secure smart contract development. This contract inherits from ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, ERC721Enumerable, and Ownable. Each of these provides essential functionalities for our NFTs, like unique identifiers, metadata storage, enumerable methods, and owner-specific privileges.

Notice the use of Counters from OpenZeppelin to keep track of token IDs. We also define a communityToken, which is an ERC20 token, to be used for transactions within this ecosystem.

The contract defines a struct, ‘NFTSaleItem’, to keep track of each NFT's sale details. We also have events like ‘NFTListedForSale’ and ‘NFTPurchased’ to broadcast important actions on the blockchain.

In the constructor, we initialize the NFT with a name and symbol and set the community token that will be used for trading these NFTs.

There are two minting functions - ‘mint’ and ‘safeMint’. The ‘mint’ function not only creates the NFT but also optionally lists it for sale. ‘safeMint’ is a more controlled version, allowing the owner to mint to a specific address.

We have several utility functions, like ‘supportsInterface’, ‘\_beforeToken

Transfer’, and ‘\_burn’, each ensuring our contract adheres to ERC721 standards and handles token transfers and burning correctly.

One of the most exciting parts of this contract is the ability to list and buy NFTs. The ‘listNFTForSale’ function allows NFT owners to list their NFTs for sale. The ‘buyNFT’ function enables users to purchase NFTs using the community ERC20 token. This function handles the transfer of the NFT and the payment transaction, ensuring a seamless trade.

We also have functions to manage sale items, like ‘getSaleItem’, ‘updateSalePrice’, and ‘getAllNFTsForSale’. These functions provide necessary information about NFTs for sale and allow sellers to update prices.

In summary, the Dragon Ball Super Ledger is a robust example of how NFTs can be created, managed, and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. It shows the power of combining ERC721 and ERC20 tokens in a single ecosystem. I encourage you to explore this contract further. Modify it, deploy it, and experiment with its features. Such hands-on experience is crucial for understanding the dynamics of NFTs and their marketplaces.
